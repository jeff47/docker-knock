Dockerized version of knock, for downloading and converting Adobe Digital Editions ACSM to EPUB or PDF


##  Knock
[Knock](https://github.com/BentonEdmondson/knock) is a useful tool for downloading and converting eBooks from Adobe Editions.  Adobe Editions itself is not needed.  This is a dockerized version of knock, so you don't need to enable user namespaces which some may consider a security risk.
